# Gemini CLI Demo: Java Application Modernization

This document summarizes a demonstration of the Gemini CLI being used to modernize a Java application. The demo showcases Gemini's ability to understand complex instructions, interact with a git repository, perform web research, modify code, and debug application startup issues.

## Scenario

The user wants to upgrade an outdated Java application to a more modern version. The process is guided by a `MIGRATE.md` file which specifies a detailed workflow for creating and executing an upgrade plan.

### Key User Prompts

-   **Initial Prompt:** "please clone the repo at github.com:duetailabs/cymbalbnb.git and then using the instruction, upgrade to a modern version of java"
-   **Follow-up Prompt:** "no, please proceed" (authorizing Gemini to execute the generated plan)
-   **Concluding Prompt:** "This seems to have updated the primary code, I will try with real infrastructure values offline"

## Gemini CLI Actions and Workflow

1.  **Setup & Planning:**
    *   Cloned the specified GitHub repository.
    *   Read and understood the upgrade instructions from `MIGRATE.md`.
    *   Created a new git branch (`upgrade/java21/25-07-16`) as instructed.
    *   Created an `.upgrade/upgrade_plan.json` file to track the modernization process.
    *   Analyzed the `pom.xml` file to understand the project structure and existing dependencies.
    *   Formulated a detailed, multi-step plan and wrote it into the `upgrade_plan.json` file.

2.  **Execution - Step 1: Dependency Update:**
    *   Used the `google_web_search` tool to find the latest stable versions for all Maven dependencies listed in the `pom.xml`.
    *   Used the `replace` tool to update the `pom.xml` with the new dependency versions.
    *   Committed the changes to the new branch with a descriptive message following the specified format: `feat(catalog): [Step 1] Update pom.xml dependencies...`.
    *   Updated the `upgrade_plan.json` to mark the step as complete, including the git commit hash.

3.  **Execution - Step 2: Code Modernization:**
    *   Read all Java source files in the `catalog` service directory.
    *   Systematically refactored the code across multiple files to use modern Java 21 features, such as:
        *   Using the `var` keyword for local variable type inference.
        *   Replacing traditional loops with the Stream API for collection processing.
        *   Modernizing string concatenation and map initialization.
    *   Committed the refactored code with the message: `feat(catalog): [Step 2] Modernize Java code...`.
    *   Updated the `upgrade_plan.json` to reflect the completion of the second step.

4.  **Execution - Step 3: Build & Test:**
    *   Attempted to build and run the application using the provided Maven command (`./mvnw spring-boot:run`).
    *   **Debugging:** The application failed to start. Gemini diagnosed the issue by:
        1.  Recognizing the initial error was due to missing environment variables.
        2.  Reading the `catalog/README.md` to identify the required variables.
        3.  Re-running the application with placeholder values for the environment variables.
        4.  Correctly concluding that the subsequent failure was due to invalid credentials, but that the application itself had compiled successfully, thus validating the code changes.
    *   Updated the `upgrade_plan.json` to mark the final step as complete, noting that local execution failed as expected without proper infrastructure credentials.

## Features & Capabilities Demonstrated

*   **Git Integration:** Cloning repositories, creating and switching branches, staging files (`git add`), and committing changes (`git commit`).
*   **File I/O:** Reading (`read_file`, `read_many_files`), writing (`write_file`), and modifying (`replace`) files.
*   **Structured Planning:** Generating a step-by-step plan and persisting it in a JSON file for tracking.
*   **Tool Use & Web Research:** Using `google_web_search` to gather real-time, external information (latest library versions) to complete a task.
*   **Code Refactoring:** Intelligently analyzing and modifying source code to introduce modern language features and improve code quality.
*   **Debugging & Problem Solving:** Diagnosing application startup failures, reading documentation to find solutions, and differentiating between code errors and environmental configuration issues.
*   **Adherence to Complex Instructions:** Following a detailed, proscribed workflow from a markdown file, including specific commit message formats and state management.
