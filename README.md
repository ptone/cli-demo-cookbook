# Gemini CLI Demo Cookbook

This repository is a cookbook of demos that showcase the features and use cases of the Gemini CLI. The demos are intended to provide practical examples of how to use the Gemini CLI to accomplish various software engineering tasks.

## Demos

Each Demo is contained in a subfolder and contains:
 - Its own documentation/README
 - Materials and code that provide a starting point for repeating the demo
 - A .cast file recording made with [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) of the demo being run


## Getting Started

To get started with these demos, you will need to have the Gemini CLI installed. You can find instructions on how to install the Gemini CLI in the [official documentation](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli).

Once you have the Gemini CLI installed, you can clone this repository and run the demos. Each demo directory contains a `README.md` file with instructions on how to run the demo.
